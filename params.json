{"name":"Rwmapmaker","tagline":"Route Map Creation for Train Simulator ","body":"Route Map Creation for Train Simulator \r\n======================================\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nRWMapMaker is a tool that creates a 2D map of a Train Simulator 2013 Route on \r\nyour computer's monitor. The map can include a representation of the height of \r\nthe land, the roads and railways within the route, and the location (but not \r\ndetailed shape) of many of the houses, trees, factories and other structures \r\nplaced within the route. There are also some not-so-obvious things that can be \r\nshown, including the boundaries of the tile files that are used by Train \r\nSimulator 2013 to store the route, the origin, to which all coordinates are \r\nreferenced. You can also read off the status bar the exact location of the \r\nmouse pointer of any point in the route. In this document, \"Train Simulator \r\n2013\" and \"TS2013\" refer to the game program created by Railsimulator.com. \r\nRWMapMaker is an independently created addon to that game. All Copyrights and \r\nTrademarks belong to their respective owners. \r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nRWMapMaker has been created as an aid to route-building using Train \r\nSimulator 2013:\r\n\r\n - As a way to get an overview of the route, what has been built \r\nand what is lacking;\r\n - As a way to quickly locate tiles in the route (to find \r\nout that \"problem in tile 3,7\" means a problem at Smith Junction);\r\n - As a way \r\nto get maps and plans for inclusion in manuals and web material;\r\n - And just to see and admire what has been done!\r\n\r\nAs development has proceeded, some other uses have become apparent:\r\n\r\n - It parses the Train Simulator 2013 files using an \r\nindependently created tools, so it can log issues that Train Simulator 2013 \r\ndoes not report, making problems easier to locate; \r\n\r\n - There are opportunities to \"mine\" the information loaded from the route, for \r\nexample to visually locate objects. While this is not done in the current \r\nversion, it is likely to be in a subsequent version. \r\n\r\n## Requirements \r\n\r\nTo run RWMapMaker you will need a computer running Microsoft Windows, as is \r\ntrue for TS2013 itself. The program has been tested on Windows 7, both 32-bit \r\nand 64-bit, and should work on Windows 7, Windows 8 (Desktop mode only) and \r\nWindows Server 2008. It may work on Windows XP (32-bit) but this is not \r\nguaranteed or supported. \r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nThe program can be built using Visual Studio 2010 SP1, and probably with Visual\r\nStudio 2012. You will also need an installation of Qt for Windows 5.2 and\r\nthe Qt Visual Studio plugin installed.\r\n\r\nBuilding the Debug variant should create an RWMapMaker executable. The Qt DLLs\r\nneed to be available to the program - either in the PATH or in the Debug\r\ndirectory itself.\r\n\r\nBuilding the Release variant should build the RWMapMaker executable and then\r\ncreate a Setup MSI file which can install it on a remote computer. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe installation MSI file is a MSI (or Microsoft Installer) file. It \r\ncan be installed by opening it on any current version of Windows. It will \r\nprompt for an installation location in the normal “wizard” style and place\r\na program start shortcut in the IvimeyCom sub-folder.\r\n\r\nTo start RWMapMaker, invoke the program shortcut. When you do this for the \r\nfirst time, you can chose whether to run the program in Trial mode, or to\r\nenter the license key you bought with the download.\r\n\r\n## Operation\r\n\r\nFor details of using the program, please refer to the manual included in\r\nthe package.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nThere are some known issues:\r\n\r\n - The pogram doesn't currently understand the Zip format of routes. In\r\n order to see such routes you have to expand the files by hand.\r\n \r\n - The maths of transition curves as implemented in Train Simulator has\r\n so far eluded me, so they are not displayed; in consequence there are some\r\n gaps in the track, though in many cases surprisingly few.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
